# Number Guessing Game
A simple number guessing game built with Python

## Description
This is a basic number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides hints to the user if their guess is too high or too low, and continues until the correct number is guessed.

## How to Play
1. Run the `number_guessing_game.py` file using Python (e.g., `python number_guessing_game.py`)
2. Follow the prompts to enter your guesses
3. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number!

## Features
* Randomly generated number between 1 and 100
* Hints provided for too high or too low guesses
* Game continues until the correct number is guessed

## Code Structure
The project consists of a single file, `number_guessing_game.py`, which contains the entire codebase. The file is organized into the following sections:
* Importing the `random` module
* Generating a random number between 1 and 100
* Main game loop with user input and hint logic
