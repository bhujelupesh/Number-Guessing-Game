# Number Guessing Game
A simple number guessing game built with Python

## Description
This is a basic number guessing game where the user can choose between two modes: Easy Mode and Hard Mode. In Easy Mode, the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100, and in Hard Mode, the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 1000 with a limited number of attempts (10 guesses).

## How to Play
1. Run the `number_guessing_game.py` file using Python (e.g., `python number_guessing_game.py`)
2. Select the mode of the game by entering 1 for Easy Mode or 2 for Hard Mode
3. Follow the prompts to enter your guesses
4. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number or run out of attempts in Hard Mode

## Features
* Two game modes: Easy Mode and Hard Mode
* Randomly generated number between 1 and 100 in Easy Mode
* Randomly generated number between 1 and 1000 in Hard Mode with 10 attempts
* Hints provided for too high or too low guesses
* Game continues until the correct number is guessed or attempts are exhausted in Hard Mode

## Code Structure
The project consists of a single file, `number_guessing_game.py`, which contains the entire codebase. The file is organized into the following sections:
* Importing the `random` module
* Game mode selection and setup
* Easy Mode game loop
* Hard Mode game loop with limited attempts
